{"name":"Opensurgsim","tagline":"","body":"Welcome to the OpenSurgSim Project\r\n\r\nOpenSurgSim is an open-source project dedicated to real-time surgical\r\nsimulation. It offers an open framework that includes the necessary building\r\nblocks for surgical simulations, such as native device support, haptic feedback,\r\ngraphics, discrete collision detection and physics simulation. OpenSurgSim is\r\nflexible. Developers can refactor the physics engine, swap models, ODE solvers,\r\nor linear system solvers. For current information and documentation about the\r\nproject, please visit our website:\r\n\r\n    http://www.opensurgsim.org/\r\n\r\nSupport can also be found on our public mailing list at\r\nopensurgsim@simquest.com. An archive of the mailing list is at:\r\n\r\n    http://groups.google.com/a/simquest.com/group/opensurgsim/\r\n\r\nTo help get started using OpenSurgSim, use the following quick start guide:\r\n\r\n    1. Getting OpenSurgSim\r\n    2. Compiling on GNU/Linux\r\n    3. Compiling on Microsoft Windows\r\n    Appendix: Dependencies\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Getting OpenSurgSim\r\n======================\r\n\r\nOpenSurgSim uses Git for source control, and this is the easiest way to obtain\r\nthe most up to date version. Resources for installing and using Git can be found\r\non Git's website (See Appendix). To obtain OpenSurgSim, run the following\r\ncommand:\r\n\r\n    git clone git://git.assembla.com/OpenSurgSim.git \r\n\r\nThis will download the source code for OpenSurgSim and place it in the\r\nOpenSurgSim directory.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Compiling on GNU/Linux\r\n=========================\r\n\r\nOpenSurgSim has been tested extensively on Debian Testing (Jessie). If you are\r\nusing another GNU/Linux distribution, please check your package management\r\nsystem for the dependencies (see Appendix). For Debian/Ubuntu based systems, the\r\ndependencies are easily installed through apt-get:\r\n\r\n    sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev cmake doxygen\r\n    sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev google-mock libopenscenegraph-dev\r\n\r\nTo build OpenSurgSim, issue the following commands from the same directory used\r\nto obtain OpenSurgSim (see Section 1)\r\n\r\n    mkdir OpenSurgSim/Build\r\n    cd OpenSurgSim/Build\r\n    cmake ../\r\n    make\r\n\r\nThat's it!\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Compiling on Microsoft Windows \r\n=================================\r\n\r\nOpenSurgSim has been developed and tested on Microsoft Windows 7, however, other\r\nversions of Windows are likely to work. At least Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 is\r\nrequired to build OpenSurgSim.\r\n\r\nFirst obtain the source code (Section 1), and install the required dependencies\r\n(Appendix). In addition, the following environment variables will help CMake\r\nautomatically find the dependencies, especially if they are not installed to the\r\ndefault locations.\r\n\r\n    BOOST_ROOT  <Path to Boost>\r\n    EIGEN_DIR   <Path to Eigen>\r\n    OSG_ROOT    <Path to OSG>\r\n\r\nAlso, add %OSG_ROOT%/bin to your PATH environment variable.\r\n\r\nGenerating the Visual Studio solution file is done with the CMake graphical user\r\ninterface. Open CMake, and enter the OpenSurgSim folder (from Section 1) into\r\nthe \"Where is the source code\" field. Then enter a new directory into the \"Where\r\nto build the binaries\" field. This folder is referred to as BUILD folder for\r\nthe purpose of the following steps.\r\n\r\nNext, click on the 'Configure' button. This will allow you to select the\r\ncompiler (Visual Studio 11 for Visual Studio 2012). If CMake reports “library\r\nnot found”, it is likely that your system variables BOOST_ROOT, EIGEN_DIR or\r\nOSG_ROOT are incorrect. Once the configuration is complete without error, click\r\non the 'Generate' button.\r\n\r\nFinally, go to the BUILD folder, open the OpenSurgSim solution file, and build\r\nthe ALL_BUILD project.\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendix: Dependencies\r\n======================\r\n\r\nTo compile OpenSurgSim, you will need the following dependencies. Many GNU/Linux\r\ndistributions already provide this software in their software repositories. If\r\nnot, or using Microsoft Windows, please refer to the installation instructions\r\nfound on each dependency's homepage.\r\n\r\nRequired Dependencies\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\n* Boost  \r\n  Homepage: http://www.boost.org/  \r\n  Modules: chrono, date_time, filesystem, system, thread  \r\n  Minimum Version: 1.54  \r\n\r\n* CMake  \r\n  Homepage: http://www.cmake.org/  \r\n  Minimum Version: 2.8  \r\n\r\n* Eigen  \r\n  Homepage: http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/  \r\n  Minimum Version: 3.2.0  \r\n\r\n* Git  \r\n  Homepage: http://www.git-scm.com/  \r\n  Minimum Version: 1.7.9  \r\n\r\n* OpenSceneGraph  \r\n  Homepage: http://www.openscenegraph.org/  \r\n  Modules: osg, osgViewer, osgText, osgUtil, osgDB, osgGA, osgAnimation  \r\n  Minimum Version: 3.2.0  \r\n\r\nOptional Dependencies\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\n* Doxygen  \r\n  Homepage: http://doxygen.org/  \r\n  Minimum Version: 1.8  \r\n\r\n* FreeGlut  \r\n  Homepage: http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/  \r\n  Minimum Version: 2.6.0  \r\n\r\n* Google Mock  \r\n  Homepage: https://code.google.com/p/googlemock/  \r\n  Minimum Version: 1.7.0  \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
